# Project-1 Final Write-Up

## Section 1: S&P500 Index Before and After Pandemic Began

Examined index historical data to determine broad impact of the pandemic on market trends.

First, examined daily trade volume of the index over each year to determine pandemic impact on market activity.

In 2019, trade volume fluctuated irregularly with a mean of approximately 7e+8 and a standard deviation of 2.6e+7. This meant that volume generally stayed within a proportionally small range of values, never exceeding 2e+8. 

In 2020, for much of the year trade volume fluctuated in a similar range as 2019 with the notable exception of March and April having a significant spike, reaching up to 3.92e+8. This spike coincided with the pandemics' first big blow-up in the United States. It also shifted the mean and standard deviation a great deal with the 2020 volume mean being 1.004e+8 and the standard deviation being 6.9e+7.

Im summary, the growth of the epidemic seemed to lead to greatly increased activity in the market.

Second, examined daily price amplitude of the index over the course of 2019 and 2020.  In this context, amplitude refers to the difference bewteen daily price high-point and low-point.  This measure gives an indication of the price volatility over the course of each day before and during the pandemic.

2019 had a mean amplitude of $2.42 with a standard deviation of $1.30 and a max of $8.97.  This showed that, during 2019, the S&P500 index had a fairly stable price each day.

In 2020 however, the mean of the price amplitude was $5.47, the standard deviation was $4.00, and the maximum was $22.39.  Compared to the previous year without the pandemic in effect, the daily price of the impact fluctuated far more with a greater magnitude.  The price instability peaked in mid-March and April but there was also multiple occasions throughout the year with spikes higher than the previous year's maximum value.

In summation, the index data strongly indicates that pandemic activity leads to price instability over the course of the day.  This information could be useful for day-traders looking to make money in the future.

## Section 2:

## Section 3: Researched and put into visualization the correlations between certain categories of stocks and how they were and still are uniquely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Looked at stocks that involve travel and human contact, as well as stocks are are completely digital, such as Zoom and Facebook. For example, in the graph below, you can see that some stocks had a positive reaction to the pandemic. ![download](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85895812/132405982-878f650f-a0d6-46b4-8293-75a4b22d8a79.png)
This raises some questions about the economy's overall health and reaction to a pandemic, such as: Is the entire market always affected?  What parts of the market are hurt by it and which ones flourish from it?  Why do some stocks rebound beyond their original position, why others stay down?
It seems there are lots of different factors that can be looked at.  For example, the stock price for United Airlines has remained down since the pandemic hit, where as the stock price for Six Flags has rebounded higher than ever, even though both involve contact with other people.  Some factors to consider are: Travel Regulations of other countries, which could be why flights are still hurting.  Also, vaccination and people's general feeling of wanting to go back to "normal" may be a contributing factor for stocks involving themeparks and movie theaters etc. to rebound.
