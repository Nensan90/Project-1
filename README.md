## Section 1: S&P500 Index Before and After Pandemic Began

Examined index historical data to determine broad impact of the pandemic on market trends.

First, examined daily trade volume of the index over each year to determine pandemic impact on market activity.

In 2019, trade volume fluctuated irregularly with a mean of approximately 7e+8 and a standard deviation of 2.6e+7. This meant that volume generally stayed within a proportionally small range of values, never exceeding 2e+8. 

In 2020, for much of the year trade volume fluctuated in a similar range as 2019 with the notable exception of March and April having a significant spike, reaching up to 3.92e+8. This spike coincided with the pandemics' first big blow-up in the United States. It also shifted the mean and standard deviation a great deal with the 2020 volume mean being 1.004e+8 and the standard deviation being 6.9e+7.

Im summary, the growth of the epidemic seemed to lead to greatly increased activity in the market.

Second, examined daily price amplitude of the index over the course of 2019 and 2020.  In this context, amplitude refers to the difference bewteen daily price high-point and low-point.  This measure gives an indication of the price volatility over the course of each day before and during the pandemic.

2019 had a mean amplitude of $2.42 with a standard deviation of $1.30 and a max of $8.97.  This showed that, during 2019, the S&P500 index had a fairly stable price each day.

In 2020 however, the mean of the price amplitude was $5.47, the standard deviation was $4.00, and the maximum was $22.39.  Compared to the previous year without the pandemic in effect, the daily price of the impact fluctuated far more with a greater magnitude.  The price instability peaked in mid-March and April but there was also multiple occasions throughout the year with spikes higher than the previous year's maximum value.

In summation, the index data strongly indicates that pandemic activity leads to price instability over the course of the day.  This information could be useful for day-traders looking to make money in the future.
